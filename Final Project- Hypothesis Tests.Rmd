### `HYPOTHESIS TESTS`
**In this case we decided to exclude straight and don't know, only including people who identified as gay or lesbian, bisexual, or something else.**

* 1) Do LGBT individuals who believe no children should need mental health resources have higher depression rates than individuals who believe all children need mental health resources?


```{r}
xtabs (~ d_SO_Down$MHLTH_NEED  + d_SO_Down$SEXUAL_ORIENTATION + d_SO_Down$DOWN)
``` 


`Group A: MHLTH_NEED = "NONE NEED"`
n = 79/142 
p1 = 55% of LGBTQ believing children do not need mental health resources feel depressed nearly every day.


`Group B: MHLTH_NEED = "ALL NEED"`
n = 44/142
p2 = 31% of LGBTQ believing all children should need mental health resources feel depressed nearly every day. 

p1 - p2 = 0.25 

sig. level = p:0.05

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
prop.test(x=c(79, 44), n=c(142, 142), alternative="two.sided", conf.level =0.95, correct = FALSE)
```

`Decision`: The null hypothesis is rejected, the sample difference in proportion (0.25) between the two groups is sig. and does not fit within the 95% region of acceptance [-0.115, 0.115].

2) Do LGBT individuals who believe no children should not get mental health resources have higher anxiety rates than individuals who believe all children should get mental health resources?


```{r}
xtabs(~ d_SO_Anxiety$MHLTH_GET + d_SO_Anxiety$SEXUAL_ORIENTATION + d_SO_Anxiety$ANXIOUS)
```


`Group A = ALL GET`
n = 65/104
p1 = 62% of LGBTQ believing all children should get mental health resources feel anxious nearly every day.

`Group B = NONE GET`
n = 26/104
p2 = 25% of LGBTQ believing all children should not get mental health resources feel anxious nearly every day. 

p1 - p2 = 0.38
sig. level = p:0.05

`Null Hypothesis: Group A = Group B`
Both the all get and none get group will have equal rates of high anxiety rates.

`Alt. Hypothesis: Group A â‰  Group B`
The all get and none get group will NOT have equal rates of high anxiety rates. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
prop.test(x=c(65, 26), n=c(104, 104), alternative="two.sided", conf.level =0.95, correct = FALSE)
```

`Decision` = null hypothesis is rejected due to the sample difference being large enough to be significant. The difference in proportion (0.38) does not fit in the 95% region of acceptance [-0.135, 0.135].
